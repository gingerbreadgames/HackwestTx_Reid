# HackwestTx_Reid
My submission for Hackwestx, a hackathon held on 9/15/24
It was my first ever hackathon and I was going to this one solo.
The theme of the hackathon was Wild West
Being a solo dev, I ended up doing a wanted poster maker
Where you can add a picture and it spits out a wanted poster with a crime and a bounty
it also ands a sepia filter to match the era of wanted posters


I used Python and the libraires Pillow, Random, os, and Flask
I also used html to allow user uploads.
